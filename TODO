There's a line of garbage at the bottom of AboutViewer, when displayed at 50%
or 25%, no private colormap, dithering on. Looks like a bug in paint_reduced().

Find a better way for SettingsDialog to access the settings.
The current approach is based on the assumption that structs are packed,
i.e. if a and b are consecutive members of a struct, that (&b - &a)
equals sizeof(a), and that is not a safe assumption.

Fix the tabbing order in SettingsDialog (should traverse the bit depth radio
buttons *before* the group of pushbuttons in the lower right corner). Is the
order currently governed by the order in which the widgets were added to the
container? May not be possible to change the order in which the widgets are
added to the container, because of the XmForm constraints... But the tabbing
order can be overridden using some resource. Check xmlgui if unsure; I seem to
remember doing just that right there.
