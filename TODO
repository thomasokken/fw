Selecting the currently selected button of a radio group causes it to be
deselected. Not good! How to prevent? Hmmm, if programmatical deselection
by Menu's group management code is always done with doCallbacks = False,
then the very fact that you find yourself in radioCB with a value that's
changing to 'false' can only mean that it's the user doing it; in that case,
just veto (i.e. set it right back to 'true' w/o invoking callbacks (and hope
that XmToggleButton can deal with being reentered like that. If not, check
the XmRowColumnWidget source code: *it* has to deal with the same problem
somehow, no?)

On a 16-bit display, jen.jpg (blown up to 1024x768 and smoothed in xv) looks
posterized if you view 24-bit color and 8-bit grayscale versions. Check
Viewer::paint(): it *should* be dithering, but is it really?
Maybe related: check the math in the dithering code, particularly rounding and
such. Note that the average pixel error almost doubles when the round-to-
nearest code in the computation of dR etc. is changed to round-down. Maybe
stuff like this accounts for some other oddities as well (such as an average
error of 2.68 in the red component in Ramp! What's that about?!?).

Find a better way for SettingsDialog to access the settings.
The current approach is based on the assumption that structs are packed,
i.e. if a and b are consecutive members of a struct, that (&b - &a)
equals sizeof(a), and that is not a safe assumption.

Fix the tabbing order in SettingsDialog (should traverse the bit depth radio
buttons *before* the group of pushbuttons in the lower right corner). Is the
order currently governed by the order in which the widgets were added to the
container? May not be possible to change the order in which the widgets are
added to the container, because of the XmForm constraints... But the tabbing
order can be overridden using some resource. Check xmlgui if unsure; I seem to
remember doing just that right there.

Low priority, especially as long as I have no access to a Sun machine:
Sun-related issues: textfields are weird (repaint problem: backspaced-over
characters do not disappear), and icons have wrong colors if display depth != 8

Low priority, especially since I don't run Mandrake 8.1 and don't plan to.
How did this get here anyway?!? Who do I know who does run it? Oh, well...
Mandrake 8.1 requires -I/usr/X11R6/include and -lXp
