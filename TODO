In paint_reduced(), the code for displaying 8-bit colormapped images when a
private colormap is in effect, is painfully slow. Finding the closest match for
a color within an arbitrary set of colors is the problem. The current
implementation is totally naive... Even if a brute-force search really can't be
avoided, that code still wants some optimizing.

Find a better way for SettingsDialog to access the settings.
The current approach is based on the assumption that structs are packed,
i.e. if a and b are consecutive members of a struct, that (&b - &a)
equals sizeof(a), and that is not a safe assumption.

Fix the tabbing order in SettingsDialog (should traverse the bit depth radio
buttons *before* the group of pushbuttons in the lower right corner). Is the
order currently governed by the order in which the widgets were added to the
container? May not be possible to change the order in which the widgets are
added to the container, because of the XmForm constraints... But the tabbing
order can be overridden using some resource. Check xmlgui if unsure; I seem to
remember doing just that right there.
