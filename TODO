The SettingsDialog code should receive focus notifications, and invoke
PluginSettings::fieldChanged() immediately (if the field has, in fact,
changed!), rather than putting it all off until the ok() callback.
Also, PluginSettings::fieldChanged() should return a bool saying whether a
change is vetoed or not. If vetoed, the focus could return to the offending
field, or the offending field could be highlighted (e.g. red background), or
something along those lines. Also, the OK action should be prevented when a
field has an error. (Cancel should always be allowed.)

In paint_reduced(), the code for displaying 8-bit colormapped images when a
private colormap is in effect, is painfully slow. Finding the closest match for
a color within an arbitrary set of colors is the problem. The current
implementation is totally naive... Even if a brute-force search really can't be
avoided, that code still wants some optimizing.

Fix the tabbing order in SettingsDialog (should traverse the bit depth radio
buttons *before* the group of pushbuttons in the lower right corner). Is the
order currently governed by the order in which the widgets were added to the
container? May not be possible to change the order in which the widgets are
added to the container, because of the XmForm constraints... But the tabbing
order can be overridden using some resource. Check xmlgui if unsure; I seem to
remember doing just that right there.
