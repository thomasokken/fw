Why does gif2tiff crash on newton.gif? Everybody else (fw itself, xv,
giftopnm, Mozilla, IE, WinJPEG, xpaint) seems to like it just fine.
Maybe it's a gif2tiff bug... Then again I'd feel a lot better if I had some
source where the *precise* details of when to send clear codes and when to
switch code sizes were documented. Writing ImageIO_GIF has felt a lot like
flying blind at times. I guess I should be thankful that it works as well as it
does now, but still, stuff like the gif2tiff problem just makes me wonder what
other surprises are still lurking in that code.
I know, I know, don't use GIF, use PNG. :-)
