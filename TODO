The greyed-out image drawn by MarianiSilver::init_clone() is often not
positioned correctly (usually (always?) too high, sometimes by quite a lot).

ImageIO_PNG seems to screw up jdbcnav/web/snapshot[34].png. Those just happen
to be 4-bit pictures. Coincidence? I think not. (Looks like it reads the pixel
data without expanding the nybbles into bytes.)
